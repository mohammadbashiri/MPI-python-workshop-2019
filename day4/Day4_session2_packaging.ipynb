    "### 2) Creating the package files\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now create a handful of files to package up this project and prepare it for distribution. Create the new files listed below - you will add content to them in the following steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5) Creating a LICENSE\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important for every package uploaded to the Python Package Index to include a license. This tells users who install your package the terms under which they can use your package. For help picking a license, see https://choosealicense.com/. Once you have chosen a license, open `LICENSE` and enter the license text. For example, if you had chosen the MIT license:\n",

    "### 6) Generating distribution archives\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to generate distribution packages for the package. These are archives that are uploaded to the Package Index and can be installed by pip. <br>\n",
    "Make sure you have the latest versions of `setuptools` and `wheel` installed:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now run this command from the same directory where `setup.py` is located:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the dist directory:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dist/\n",
    "  example_pkg_your_username-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n",
    "  example_pkg_your_username-0.0.1.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Uploading the distribution archives\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it’s time to upload your package to the Python Package Index! <br>\n",
    "The first thing you’ll need to do is register an account on Test PyPI. Test PyPI is a separate instance of the package index intended for testing and experimentation. It’s great for things like this tutorial where we don’t necessarily want to upload to the real index. To register an account, go to https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ and complete the steps on that page. You will also need to verify your email address before you’re able to upload any packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are registered, you can use twine to upload the distribution packages. You’ll need to install Twine:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --user --upgrade twine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, run Twine to upload all of the archives under dist:\n",
    "```\n",
    "twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once uploaded your package should be viewable on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing your newly uploaded package\n",
    "You can use pip to install your package and verify that it works. Create a new virtualenv and install your package from TestPyPI:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ example-pkg-your-username\n",
    "```\n",
    "Make sure to specify your username in the package name!\n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether everything went well, we can try to display the `name` variable which we entered into the `__init__.py` initially:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> import example_pkg\n",
    ">>> example_pkg.name\n",
    "'example_pkg'\n",
    "```"
