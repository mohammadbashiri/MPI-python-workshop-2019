    "\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. For instance, an object could represent:\n",
    "- A person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or \n",
    "- An email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions."

    "### Classes\n",
    "Each thing or object is an instance of some *class*. Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. In the case of a person, we could create an `Person()` class to track properties about the person like the name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that a class just provides structure—it’s a blueprint for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. `Person()` class may specify that the name and age are necessary for defining a person, but it will not actually state what a specific person’s name or age is. It may help to think of a class as an idea for how something should be defined."

   "source": [
    "### Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "While the class is the blueprint, an *instance* is a copy of the class with actual values, literally an object belonging to a specific class. It’s not an idea anymore; it’s an actual person, like someone who is named Mohammad abd is twenty five years old. Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. It defines the needed information. After you fill out the form, your specific copy is an instance of the class; it contains actual information relevant to the actual object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can fill out multiple copies to create many different instances, but without the form as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required. Thus, before you can create individual instances of an object, we must first specify what is needed by defining a class."
