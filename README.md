# Python Beginner Workshop
This workshop introduces the basic elements of Python, as well as tools that are commonly used for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and other applications. Participants will gain the knowledge needed to start programming and using Python in everyday tasks. This workshop is intended for scientists who are new to programming. No experience is required.

Please bring your own laptop with:
- the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6 (www.anaconda.com/download/) installed.
- One of the following text editors installed: Atom(https://atom.io/) or Sublime(https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

The Python standard library likely has everything you need, but we won't stop there. We'll make use of some of the more popular third-party libraries, which will also let us make use of the tool pip for grabbing libraries from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

You will leave the class with working sample code that you developed that is (hopefully) helpful in your day-to-day job.
