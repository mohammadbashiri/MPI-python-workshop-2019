    "- **Python script**: Is essentially a text file that contains Python code, and has the extension of `.py` (It's great for prjects where we want to have a single file, just like a library, that provides us with functions to be used in our project). and we can run them in the shell application by typing `python script_name.py`.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: Is also an application that let's us write Python code, with the advantage that we can divide our code into different cells and test them independently. It also provides a nice integration between code and text, which makes it very suitable for taking notes and writing reports.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Lab**: Is a user interface, were all of the above are integrated. It includes the Shell application, a text editor, as well as the Notebook.\n",
    "- **Standard and third-party libraries**: there are many libraries out there that provide extra utilities for Python. Some of these are shipped with the Python application (standard libraries) and some other need to be installed independently (third-party libraries). The third-party libraries can be installed using the command `pip install name_of_the_package`.\n",
    "- **Namespaces and Objects**: Namespaces are memory spaces within which names are unique (be it name of a variable or a function, or anything else). Anything that occupies memory space is in fact an object, and therefore has variables and functions attached to it"
